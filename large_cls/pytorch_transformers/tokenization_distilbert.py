    Constructs a DistilBertTokenizer.
    :class:`~pytorch_transformers.DistilBertTokenizer` is identical to BertTokenizer and runs end-to-end tokenization: punctuation splitting + wordpiece

    Args:
        vocab_file: Path to a one-wordpiece-per-line vocabulary file
        do_lower_case: Whether to lower case the input. Only has an effect when do_wordpiece_only=False
        do_basic_tokenize: Whether to do basic tokenization before wordpiece.
        max_len: An artificial maximum length to truncate tokenized sequences to; Effective maximum length is always the
            minimum of this value (if specified) and the underlying BERT model's sequence length.
        never_split: List of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
            do_wordpiece_only=False
