ROBERTA_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The RoBERTa model was proposed in
    `RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach`_
    by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer,
    Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.
    
    It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining
    objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.
    
    This implementation is the same as BertModel with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup for Roberta pretrained 
    models.

    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and
    refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692

    .. _`torch.nn.Module`:
        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#module

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~pytorch_transformers.RobertaConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the 
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.
"""

ROBERTA_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            To match pre-training, RoBERTa input sequence should be formatted with <s> and </s> tokens as follows:

            (a) For sequence pairs:

                ``tokens:         <s> Is this Jacksonville ? </s> </s> No it is not . </s>``

            (b) For single sequences:

                ``tokens:         <s> the dog is hairy . </s>``

            Fully encoded sequences or sequence pairs can be obtained using the RobertaTokenizer.encode function with 
            the ``add_special_tokens`` parameter set to ``True``.

            RoBERTa is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on
            the right rather than the left.

            See :func:`pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`pytorch_transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **attention_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional` need to be trained) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Optional segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs.
            This embedding matrice is not trained (not pretrained during RoBERTa pretraining), you will have to train it
            during finetuning.
            Indices are selected in ``[0, 1]``: ``0`` corresponds to a `sentence A` token, ``1``
            corresponds to a `sentence B` token
            (see `BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding`_ for more details).
        **position_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings.
            Selected in the range ``[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1[``.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
